  +"question": """
    Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. Implement a function that takes a string as an input and returns the length of the longest substring. 
    
    **Example:** 
    Input: "abcabcbb" 
    Output: 3 
    Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
    
    Input: "bbbbb" 
    Output: 1 
    Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1. 
    
    Input: "pwwkew" 
    Output: 3 
    Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring,
"pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
